# Deep Hedging and Deep Pricing

This project is a deep hedging and deep pricing framework with the primary purpose of furthering research into the use of neural networks as a replacement for classical analytical methods for pricing and hedging financial instruments.

The project is built in Python on top of TensorFlow and Keras.

The project was originally developed by engineers at [Beacon Platform](https://beacon.io) to conduct research into the deep hedging technique and foster collaboration within the finance industry and with academia.

If you are using this in your own project or research, we would be interested to hear from you.

## Coming Soon

- PyPi package
- ReadTheDocs documentation
- Example Jupyter Notebooks
